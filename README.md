# Rubik's Cube Simulator
A console Rubik's Cube simulator with solver. I used a genetic algorithm for solving a cube.

Available commands:
- new: creates a new solved cube cube
- solve: prints a combination to solve the current cube
- randomize X: performs X random rotations on the current cube
- print: prints current cube to console
- apply X: applies a move with a name X to the current cube
- load X: loads a cube from a file with a name X
- help: prints a list of available commands
- moves: prints a list of available moves
- quit: close a program
